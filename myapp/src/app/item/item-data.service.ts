   // the function push(...params) has a rest operator ...params
   // i:e caller of push can specify any number of params as in push(param1, param2, param3, and so on)
   // rest operator can turn a variable number of parameters into an array
   // if you put ... infornt of function argument it means it accepts any number of params separated by comas
   // inside push() function ...params turns into array[]
   this.wordsArr.push("hello","how", "are", "you");

   //the spread operator can do the opposite: turn an array into a list of arguments. ‚Äù
   // if you put ... infront of an arr[] variable it expands into coma searapated params arr[0],arr[1],arr[2] and so on
   this.wordsArr.push(...this.strArr);

   // the advantage of ... either in front of function param or in fornt of arr variable is that
    // push(...params) params becomes params[] inside push function
    //...[param1,param2,param3] expands into coma separated list so that caller of push() has choice to pack them together at one place
